  "HOME.about.text":"Fridays For Future is a movement of people that aim to address societal issues in their complexities. We are  fighting to stop climate change, to amplify the scientific community's alarms, and to report the governments' failure in tackling climate change.<br><br>We are part of a global, pacifist and non-party related movement, which strongly opposes any kind of discrimination. As the younger generation, we are set to pay the highest price for an unfair and unsustainable economic model, if we are not able to change the system in order to stop climate change in its tracks.<br><br>We are independent from any political party, and only respond to the assembles in which people take part in order to fight for each and everyone's future. We refuse any sort of labelisation: Nobody other than our people represents us, nor do we fly any flag. Our voice comes solely from the assemblies and the mobilisation squares.",
  "HOME.what.title":"What Do We Want",
  "HOME.what.text":"We demand governments to act on climate change, recognizing the emerging climate catastrophe, by stopping the Earth's temperature from increasing by over 1.5 Â°C. Our country needs to completely decarbonise the energy production process as soon as possible.<br><br>In order to protect the ecosystem, a radical change in the socioeconomic system is needed: It is necessary to deconstruct a system that puts profit before life, polluting and devastating territories in the process, all in the illusion of an infinitesimal economic paradigm in a world with \"infinite\" resources.<br><br>Our claim of a systematic change is declined on the territories, with the opposition to any kind of environmental devastation, including harmful works for our own ecosystems. \"Think global, act local\" is a great principle of ours that drives us to support territorial environmental conflicts.<br><br>We seek to build a circular economical system, that involves a change in our lifestyles, combined with a means of production that is based on respect for the environment, and for social and climate justice. Those who have polluted, and enriched themselves with this unbearable economic system, must finance the costs for an ecological conversion.<br><br>Public education and research should propose alternative development models, by abandoning obsolete ideas and teaching methods, including school-work alternation as well as university internships in companies that are responsible for environmental devastation.",
